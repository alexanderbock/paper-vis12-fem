To Whom It May Concern,

we would like to thank you and your co-reviewers for the work you have done and the many valuable comments we have received regarding our submission. In our revision, we did our best in order to address all of the issues you have brought up. Below, you will find our detailed replies to the points of criticism brought up by the reviewers. 

The remainder of this cover letter is structured as follows. First, we cite the comments of the reviewers, and then we explain, what changes we have undertaken in order to address these comments. All replies are structured based on the specific reviewers, whereby we start with the summary rating.

We would also like to point out that we have slightly changed the title of the paper, which seems to be more appropriate based on the references suggested by the reviewers. We have changed 'higher-order' to 'high-order' and replaced 'exploration' with 'visualization'. Hopefully this is acceptable with you, otherwise we will of course take back these modifications.

We hope that all comments have been addressed as expected,
 The authors.

As stated above, we have changed the structure of the paper accordingly and moved the workflow figure into the introduction section, such that we could give a high-level description of the presented approaches early on. Here, we also refer to the clustering and the preprocessing costs.

Samples are taken equidistantly in world space instead of material space.

A subsection addressing the memory footprint was added.

Explained in the text that we are not limited to any order.

We have clarified our understanding of interactivity in the introduction, and further 
elaborate on it in the performance analysis section. Furthermore, we have added the
suggested references and relate to them.

We have included and addressed the suggested papers in the related works section.

The straight-forward approach is better explained and referenced in the necessary sections.

We have addressed this issue in the introduction within the high-level
description of our workflow.

Thanks for pointing out these details, we have fixed all these errors.

Did that. Replace "state-of-the-art" by "straight-forward" though.

   > The authors hit on all the key evaluation criteria of their method:
   > speed, size, and accuracy.  But again, they need to compare these aspects
   > with the previous state-of-the-art.
   
Better explained why the straight-forward method is the better comparison partner.

~~Nothing changed~~
The impact was already given in Table 1, where the only difference is the performed mapping
(SF) and the spline approximations.

   > The paper focuses on interactivity, but doesn't provide a definition of
   > what interactive means.
   
We have addressed that as explained in our reply to the comments of the Secondary Reviewer.


   > Section 3, Second paragraph:  What is an associated material property,
   > and how does that relate to the mapping between material and world space?
   
The term 'associated material property' was misleading. We have rewritten the sentence accordingly.


   > Section 3, Third Paragraph:  The first two sentences are confusing.  Any

Yes, these sentences were indeed misleading. We have now clarified, that any access to the field data requires the transformation into material space.   


   > Section 4.1, second paragraph:  The sentence starting "While these points
   > should ..." is confusing.
   
Fixed.


   > Section 4.1, ".. based on the extend of a face..." -> "... based on the
   > extents of a face..."

Fixed.

A clarifying part was included to make the dense population in world space clear.
The even spacing in world space is already included

This part was extended and the viewing direction idea was clarified.
Further, we assume no high-frequency changes

   > Section 4.1, 5th paragraph:  What is meant by "fairly continuous" proxy

The sentence was clarified.

The reference to a naive clustering was removed.

Reference to the error analysis was included as a reasoning.

It is now.

The section about equidistant spacing in material space was removed.

This was elaborated on, and the editorial error of the reduction of rays was removed.

A comparison was generated and elaborated on in the Error Analysis section

The reduction appears indirectly by increasing the similarity used in the clustering.
This is better explained now.

This point was elaborated on in the paper now.

provided.
