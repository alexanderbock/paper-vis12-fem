To Whom It May Concern,

we would like to thank you and your co-reviewers for the work you have done and the many valuable comments we have received regarding our submission. In our revision, we did our best in order to address all of the issues you have brought up. Below, you will find our detailed replies to the points of criticism brought up by the reviewers. 

The remainder of this cover letter is structured as follows. First, we cite the comments of the reviewers, and then we explain, what changes we have undertaken in order to address these comments. All replies are structured based on the specific reviewers, whereby we start with the summary rating.

We would also like to point out that we have slightly changed the title of the paper, which seems to be more appropriate based on the references suggested by the reviewers. We have changed 'higher-order' to 'high-order' and replaced 'exploration' with 'visualization'. Hopefully this is acceptable with you, otherwise we will of course take back these modifications.

We hope that all comments have been addressed as expected,
 The authors.





Summary Rating

Secondary Reviewer
==================

   > The work does not make it abundantly clear that they are dealing with
   > hexahedral high-order FEM.  The reviewer agrees that this is certainly an
   > important area and commonly used in solid mechanics, but it is a
   > limitation of the current system as it is not clear how well some of the
   > coherency assumptions would hold when one looked at the mappings used for
   > prisms, pyramids and tetrahedra.

   > It is not clear if the authors are considering only straight-sided or
   > curved-faced elements.  The statements made concerning the mappings to
   > the reference domain remain correct, but the statements about the
   > "coherency" may be changed based upon how severe the mappings are.

   > The authors need to make their definition of "interactivity" clear.  They

Reviewer 1
==========

   > A high level overview of the algorithm could also help in guiding the
   > reader.  The authors describe these "proxy rays" near the start of the
   > paper, but it is somewhat unclear how these rays will actually be used
   > until much later in the paper.

We have addressed this issue in the introduction within the high-level
description of our workflow.

   > Overall, the grammar of the paper is good.  The following are some errors
   > I found:
   > - Missing a pronoun in "This combination allows to exploit the ..."
   > - Did you mean "extent" in the sentence "... based on the extend of a
   > face in world space"
   > - "... space is reconstructed from ***the the*** ..."
   > - Did you mean "negligible" in "... bias is of neglectable, which ..."
   > - Just below the previous error you are describing figure 6, but you are
   > using "(a) (b)" when there is no a/b in the figure.
   > - On page 6 you wrote "the thus" in two different sentences... guessing
   > you meant to remove "thus" in each case
   > - The sentences starting with "When we for instance ..." and "Here it
   > could be explored, how..." are ill-formed

Thanks for pointing out these details, we have fixed all these errors.




Reviewer 3
==========

   > The paper focuses on interactivity, but doesn't provide a definition of
   > what interactive means.

   > Section 3, Second paragraph:  What is an associated material property,
   > and how does that relate to the mapping between material and world space?

   > Section 3, Third Paragraph:  The first two sentences are confusing.  Any
   > visualization of the high-order field, not just volume visualization,
   > requires the transformation to material space (otherwise the
   > visualization will not have access to the field data).  These first two
   > sentences seem to say that other types of visualization don't require
   > material space.

   > Section 4.1, second paragraph:  The sentence starting "While these points
   > should ..." is confusing.

   > Section 4.1, ".. based on the extend of a face..." -> "... based on the
   > extents of a face..."





Reviewer 5
==========

   > In the introduction it is not made clear why curved viewing rays are
   > needed. This explanation is postponed until Section 3. 
   
   > Section 4.1 middle: the sentence "... to the uniformity of P are
   > coherence rather loose due to the intra-element." does not make much
   > sense to me.
