To Whom It May Concern,

we would like to thank you and your co-reviewers for the work you have done and the many valuable comments we have received regarding our submission. In our revision, we did our best in order to address all of the issues you have brought up. Below, you will find our detailed replies to the points of criticism brought up by the reviewers. 

The remainder of this cover letter is structured as follows. First, we cite the comments of the reviewers, and then we explain, what changes we have undertaken in order to address these comments. All replies are structured based on the specific reviewers, whereby we start with the summary rating.

We would also like to point out that we have slightly changed the title of the paper, which seems to be more appropriate based on the references suggested by the reviewers. We have changed 'higher-order' to 'high-order' and replaced 'exploration' with 'visualization'. Hopefully this is acceptable with you, otherwise we will of course take back these modifications.

We hope that all comments have been addressed as expected,
 The authors.

Samples are taken equidistantly in world space. (NOTE: redo figures)

As stated above, we have changed the structure of the paper accordingly and moved the workflow figure into the introduction section, such that we could give a high-level description of the presented approaches early on. Here, we also refer to the clustering and the preprocessing costs.

We asked an English native speaker to proof read the paper and have addressed all spotted issues.

Samples are taken equidistantly in world space instead of material space.

We have clarified our understanding of interactivity in the introduction, and further ellaborate on it in the performance analysis section. Furthermore, we have added the suggested references and relate to them.

We have included and addressed the suggested papers in the related works section.

We have addressed this issue in the introduction within the high-level
description of our workflow.

Thanks for pointing out these details, we have fixed all these errors.




Reviewer 3
==========

   > The paper focuses on interactivity, but doesn't provide a definition of
   > what interactive means.
   
We have addressed that as explained in our reply to the comments of the Secondary Reviewer.


   > Section 3, Second paragraph:  What is an associated material property,
   > and how does that relate to the mapping between material and world space?
   
The term 'associated material property' was misleading. We have rewritten the sentence accordingly.


   > Section 3, Third Paragraph:  The first two sentences are confusing.  Any
   > visualization of the high-order field, not just volume visualization,
   > requires the transformation to material space (otherwise the
   > visualization will not have access to the field data).  These first two

   > material space.
   
Yes, these sentences were indeed misleading. We have now clarified, that any access to the field data requires the transformation into material space.   


   > Section 4.1, second paragraph:  The sentence starting "While these points
   > should ..." is confusing.
   
Fixed.


   > Section 4.1, ".. based on the extend of a face..." -> "... based on the
   > extents of a face..."

Fixed.

Samples are taken equidistantly in world space now instead of material space.


Reviewer 5
==========

   > In the introduction it is not made clear why curved viewing rays are
   > needed. This explanation is postponed until Section 3.
   
We have addressed this issue in the high-level explanation, where we relate the straight viewing rays to the curves in material space.

   > In Section 3 the notion of curvilinear finite elements is not
   > explained. The elements shown in Figure 2(a) seem not to be curvilinear.
   > Further down in that section: What is supposed to be meant by: "If we
   > assume that each element e_j is defined over the [0,1] interval in \xi"?
   > How can a multi-dimensional element be defined over a one-dimensional
   > interval? 
   
The figures have been regenerated to better show the curvilinearity. A better explanation
w.r.t. the dimensionality was added.
 
   > Section 4.1 middle: the sentence "... to the uniformity of P are
   > coherence rather loose due to the intra-element." does not make much
   > sense to me.
   
We have fixed this sentence.

   > The curved rays in Fig 3 are hard to decipher. 

The figure has been regenerated.
