Title: Interactive Exploration of Curvilinear Finite Element Models

Reviewer:           primary

Summary Review Text

  All four reviewers agree in that the paper in its current form cannot be
  accepted at EuroVis 2012. The major reasons are:

  - neither is related work in the field referenced adequately, nor do the
    authors perform a comparison to any existing approach,

  - the proposed method performs approximations which can result in severe
  loss of accuracy, an issue that is not discussed at all,

  - the method can introduce a sever increase in memory, due to the memory
  footprint of storing precomputed rays,

  - the presented results are not convincing and do not demonstrate the
  advantages of the presented method over other methods, neither with
  respect to quality nor speed,

  - the technical realization is partly unclear, including a clear analysis
  of the accuracy/memory/speed tradeoff.

Argumentation Overall Rating

  The paper presents a volume rendering technique for curvilinear grids. It
  "pre-computes" for a set of representative elements and a set of
  pre-defined directions the sample positions on the rays along these
  directions. At run-time, at these positions - relative to a current
  element - the samples are taken and combined.

  I major criticism is threefold (apart from a number of technical issues
  which are not discussed appropriately): First, the approach introduces a
  number of approximations which can easily result in severy
  misclassifications. Second, conceptually the approach seems to be a
  classical, somewhat adaptive resmapling approach. Thus, it falls into a
  category which the authors themselves classify as not acceptable. Third,
  any comparison to related approaches - and to ground truth visualizations
  - is missing entirely. As such, to this end there is no evidence that the
  proposed exhaustive machinery has any practical benefit.

The Review

  First of all I have to say that I found the discussion of finite element
  techniques a little irritating. The authors are talking about curvilinear
  grids, made up of deformed hexahedral elements, where each vertex is
  associated with a nodal shape function defining the interpolation in a
  cell's interior. Thus, I don't see any evidence to elaborate on finite
  element techniques here, in particular not because it is never said what
  kind of basis functions are used in the simulation. It is just stated at
  the beginning that "Since the data within an element is usually defined
  through higher order basis functions, extensive computation is be
  necessary to reconstruct the data during ray-casting.", but later it is
  never said what kind of basis functions are currently used.

  Second, what the authors do is essentially a resampling process, i.e.,
  the positions of samples in each element are pre-computed along spline
  curves. The difference to classical resampling approaches is that the
  sample positions are to a certain extent aligned to the elements shapes
  at run-time and the data values are reconstructed at run-time. However,
  it would be intersting, and absolutely mandatory, to compare the
  presented approach to a classical resampling approach which simply
  defines element-dependent regular resampling structures and then
  interpolates in these structures. Furthermore, it is not said how a
  particular transfer function - causing high frequencies in the values
  along a ray - affect the precomputed spline curves; or do you compute
  these curves independently of a particular color mapping.

  Thirdly, with respect to the aforementioned the assumption that errors
  are more severy close to the entry points into a cell is simply wrong.

  Fourth, the only reason why the proposed pre-computation might be
  practible is because inter-element coherence and intra-element coherence
  can be exploited. However, I strongly doubt that this is true in general
  for any non-trivial grid topology. And even if so, the proposed
  methodology would always introduce errors, which, at least in my opinion,
  can be quite severe. A rigorous analysis of these errors is mandatory.

  Finally, since the paper is about curvilinear grids - even though I could
  not find any aspects specific to such grids in the paper, a more thorough
  comparison to the current state of the art has to be given, for instance,
  with respect to

  Efficient Rendering of Extrudable Curvilinear Volumes
  Martin, Han-Wei Shen, Ravi Samtaneyâ€¡

  Visualization of Time-Varying Curvilinear Grids Using a 3D Warp Texture
  Yuan Chen, Jonathan Cohen, Subodh Kumar

  Furthermore, resampling approaches as well as volume rendering approaches
  for unstructured grids are not considered. These techniques are
  significantly faster than the proposed one, at the same or even better
  approximation quality.

  paramterization in a curved volume space. The idea is novel, but the
  results are not convincing, and the presentation needs to be improved.

The Review

  This paper proposes a novel technique for visualizing curvilinear finite
  element models. To address the challenge of curved ray marchin in the
  volume parametreization space, the transformation from the world space to
  the volume texture space in terms of each element is characterized with a
  set of clustered curved rays. These rays are precomputed within a
  generation-reconstruction-clustering process.
  I like the idea and believe it is a potentially useful technique.

  However, this paper exhibits two main drawbacks:
  1) The presented results are very weak, and can not demonstrate the
  advantages of the presented method;
  2) The presentation of the algorithm details (Section 4) is a little bit
  vague. Specially, how to generate a set of proxy ray for different shaped
  curvilinear elements is unclear for me. I would suggest the authors to
  reorganize the description.

Argumentation Overall Rating

  I really like the proposed approach, perceptually the idea to sample and
  characterize the possible rays into a representative set of rays and use
  them to lower run-time computing cost for coordinate transform. However,
  many technical details and essential evaluations are missing, making the
  paper less complete to be well justified. I encourage the authors to push
  forward this interesting idea more thoroughly and address the concerns to
  make the paper well-acceptable.

The Review

  The paper presents a two-stage approach for ray-casting curvilinear
  finite element models. In the pre-processing stage, the authors sampled
  the faces of each element of a FE grid, enumerated and constructed all
  the possible rays, and used the k-means method to generate the
  representative rays. In the run-time stage, for each pixel, the
  corresponding ray parameters are retrieved and reconstructed from the
  pre-generated results. The ray-casting can be performed at an interactive
  frame rate, which has been demonstrated with the performance results
  using a single GPU. The overall idea to sampling and characterization of
  rays looks novel, and the proposed approach may have a potential impact
  on practices of visualizing curvilinear finite element meshes. In
  addition, visualization of FE meshes is an important topic, and this work
  is relevant for the event and would be of interest to readers of the
  EuroVis symposium.

  However, the paper has several weaknesses. Especially, many technical
  details and essential evaluation are missing. The effectiveness and
  feasibility of the approach are not entirely convincing.

  * In Section 4, the statements on inter-element coherence and
  intra-elements coherence are less rigorous. The authors need to provide
  solid validations.

  * In Section 4.1, what is the grid structure overlapping each face of a
  FE? From Figure 3, it seems a uniform sampling imposed with an irregular
  grid. But the authors didnâ€™t provide the details on how to construct
  this grid.

  * In Section 4.1, the assumption for different grid resolutions is mainly
  based on ray attenuation. However, would this method using different grid
  resolutions be valid for both the orthogonal and perspective projections?
  Moreover, as transfer functions could be application-specific, would the
  assumption be valid with the constraints of transfer function?

  * In Section 4.1, it is also unclear how to compute importance values to
  determine the number of grid points. Moreover, the proxy ray method
  imposes a quartic complexity, and the scalability with respect to
  sampling points is questionable.

  * In Section 4.2, the spline generation for a FE volume is essentially as
  complex as a ray casting procedure. It is unclear how to effectively
  carry out this procedure for curvilinear finite element models.  The
  details, such as mesh management, ray marching, and enumerating all pairs
  of sampling points, are missing.

  * In Section 4.3, it is unclear how to determine the number of clusters.

  * In Section 5.1, usually different elements can have different numbers
  of faces. What is the structure of a 2D table with num_cells * num_faces
  cells? In addition, how do you partition the cells based on the number of
  start points and end points?

  * In Section 5.3, it is unclear how to compute the data value at each
  sample point. Also, during ray marching, what is the scheme to find the
  start point of the current cell from the end point of the previous cell?
  According to Section 4.1, two neighbor cells may have different grid
  resolutions, and thus the sampling points may not be perfectly aligned
  along the border.

  * In Section 6.1, the authors didnâ€™t compare their work with the
  existing works, which is essential for a research paper.

  * In Section 6.2, what error metric has been used in evaluation?

  * In Section 6.3, the detailed descriptions of experimental settings,
  parameter space, and data are missing. The paper also didnâ€™t provide
  the memory cost of the approach. The pre-processing cost seems too high
  for large data, and could be prohibitive for AMR grids. It would be
  interesting to analysis errors and test performance with  the exploration
  of the parameter space, such as number of sampled proxy rays, number of
  clusters, data size, inter-/intra-element coherence assessment, and so
  on. The effectiveness, scalability, and feasibility of the approach can
  not be well justified from the current result.

  Minor suggestions:

  In general, the figures are relatively small, and can be enlarged to use
  the available space. The indexes of Figures 6 and 7 need be switched.

Argumentation Overall Rating

  This paper presents an approach for using precomputed view rays to speed
  up the raycasting of curvilinear grids. The feasibility of the presented
  spline fitting and clustering approach is not clear and not evaluated.
  The paper consists of arbitrary design choices without clear motivation.
  Precomputation times are extremely long, and the reduction in rendering
  quality is unclear. The memory footprint of storing precomputed rays is
  not stated. There are no comparisons with previous methods.

The Review

  The paper presents an approach for clustering all possible view rays for
  rendering curvilinear grids that seems to consist of arbitrary design
  choices that are neither motivated nor evaluated.

  The approach is presented as a collection of solutions without evaluating
  their impact on quality, memory usage, or comparing to previous work.

  There is no validation of the presumed "intra-element" and
  "inter-element" coherence. How true are these statements, and how do the
  properties of different grids and basis functions influence this?

  How well do the computed Catmull-Rom splines approximate the real curved
  rays? Why were Catmull-Rom splines chosen?

  Why is k-means clustering used instead of a non-parametric technique, and
  how is k chosen? Fig. 12 does not tell me more than what is written in
  the text, that increasing the number of clusters decreases the error.

  There is not much information on the meshes used. What are the mesh
  resolutions, the basis functions, etc.?

  The evaluation consists of Fig. 11 (visual comparison) where no
  differences are visible, and Fig. 12 which contains relative instead of
  absolute errors. What is the real error incurred by this technique?

  I would say that the precomputation times reported in 6.3 make the
  approach impractical.

  What are the memory requirements of the proposed method?

  There should be a detailed comparison with Ueffinger et al.'s approach.
  Unlike what is stated in the paper, their paper also reports performance
  on a single PC, not only on clusters.

  The references are incomplete. The depth peeling approach seems to be
  based on the work of Garrity et al., which is not cited, etc.
