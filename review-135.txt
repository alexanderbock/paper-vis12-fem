Second Round Recommendation

   

Summary Review Text

   All four reviewers agree in that the paper in its current form cannot be
   accepted at EuroVis 2012. The major reasons are:

   - neither is related work in the field referenced adequately, nor do the 
     authors perform a comparison to any existing approach,

   - the proposed method performs approximations which can result in severe
   loss of accuracy, an issue that is not discussed at all,

   - the method can introduce a sever increase in memory, due to the memory
   footprint of storing precomputed rays,
    
   - the presented results are not convincing and do not demonstrate the
   advantages of the presented method over other methods, neither with
   respect to quality nor speed, 

   - the technical realization is partly unclear, including a clear analysis
   of the accuracy/memory/speed tradeoff.
